The GAP 4 package 'NormalizInterface'
=====================================

1 Package description
=====================

Normaliz is a software for computations with rational cones and affine
monoids. It pursues two main computational goals: finding the Hilbert
basis, a minimal generating system of the monoid of lattice points of a
cone; and counting elements degree-wise in a generating function, the
Hilbert series.
As a recent extension, Normaliz can handle unbounded polyhedra. The
Hilbert basis computation can be considered as solving a linear
diophantine system of inhomogeneous equations, inequalities and
congruences.

This package encapsulates a libnormaliz cone and gives access to it in the
GAP enviroment. In this way GAP can be used as interactive interface to
libnormaliz.



2 Installation preparation
==========================

You should use the same gmp version for GAP and libnormaliz. To ensure
this you can use a system installed gmp for GAP by configuring it with

./configure --with-gmp=system

Next you need Normaliz, go to www.math.uos.de/normaliz and download the
basic package which includes the source code. Unpack it and follow the 
instructions for compilation with cmake in source/INSTALL. Remember to use
the same compiler and gmp version as for GAP. 


3 Configure NoramlizInterface
=============================

autoconf (only for developers? TODO)
./configure --with-normaliz=<path>
make

The <path> should specify the path to the normaliz installation directory
